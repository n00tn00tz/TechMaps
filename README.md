# TechMaps

This project aims to create cool, physical maps of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute campus. Currently, we are working on the wooden laser cut. Future maps could be made with additive manufacturing of plastic, laser cut on metal, and PCBs. Ultimately, we hope that WPI offers these maps to students and parents for both their technical utility and WPI "tech" aesthetic.
